# Flappy_Bird_with_TML5  

Hi, this is another repo milking the flappy bird game I fixed together with duct tape and tons of tea (I don't drink so this was the only compromise).

For this project, I made use of the new teachable machines released by google and the ml5.js library. You can find resources for these things below:  

Google teachable machines: [Link](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)  
ml5.js: [Link](https://ml5js.org/)

## Example of how it works  
Go to the link of the website, either above or [here]('https://chuanhao01.github.io/Flappy_Bird_with_TML5/')  

So when you load in, you will see the game loaded in the browser.  
Let the browser have access to your webcam and press `p`.  
Also remember to refresh the page if it lags.  

### How the game works.

Make your hands into a triangle shape for the bird to jump and move your hands away if you do not want the bird to jump.

## How the TML5 code works
Refer to my other repo [here](https://github.com/chuanhao01/TML5_JS).
